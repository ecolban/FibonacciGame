The following game is borrowed from one of Martin Gardner's books:
 
The game is played between two players who take turns removing coins from a
pile of coins initially containing at least two coins. The player who removes
the last coin wins. The player who goes first must remove at least one coin
but not all the coins. Thereafter, each player must remove at least one coin,
but not more than twice the number that the other player removed last.
 
Martin Gardner provides the following hint on how to play this game: The
player who goes first can always win unless the initial number of coins is a
number in the Fibonacci sequence, in which case the player who goes second
can always win.
 
 - How many coins should the player who goes first remove if the initial
   number of coins is 7?

 - How many coins should the player who goes first remove if the initial
   number of coins is 20?
 
The answer to the second question above is not 7. If you remove 7, then your
opponent can remove 13 and win.
 
The purpose of this project is to provide an exercise in recursive functions.
The nature of the game itself leads to "recursive thinking". Can't win a game
of 20 by removing 7? Break the game into two games; one of 13 and the other
of 7. If you win the game of 7, then your opponent will be in a position
where there are 13 coins in the pile and he/she cannot remove them all.
